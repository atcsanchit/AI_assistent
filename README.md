## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- API keys for AI services (Deepgram, Mistral, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/atcsanchit/AI_assistent.git
cd AI_assistent
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your API keys
```

4. Run the assistant:
```bash
cd ../chatbot-server
npm run start-dev
cd electron-project
npm start
python main.py
```

## 📋 Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# API Keys
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_api_key_here
PORT=your_port_number_here
```

## 🛠️ Usage

- Start speaking after launching the assistant.
- Your voice is converted to text (via Deepgram).
- The text is processed by the LLM (Mistral or GPT-based model).
- The assistant responds using TTS.
- Responses and logs are printed on terminal / GUI.
```
